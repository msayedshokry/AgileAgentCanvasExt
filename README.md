# Agile Agent Canvas

**Visual AI-assisted product development with the BMAD methodology.**

Agile Agent Canvas brings a structured, AI-powered approach to product development directly into VS Code. Design your product vision, break it down into epics and stories, define requirements, plan architecture, and track implementation readiness — all through an interactive visual canvas and AI chat workflows.

---

## Features

### Visual Canvas

A 4-lane workflow canvas that gives you a bird's-eye view of your entire product:

- **Discovery** — Product briefs, vision documents, and PRDs
- **Planning** — Requirements, use cases, and test strategies
- **Solutioning** — Architecture decisions and design specs
- **Implementation** — Epics, stories, and test cases organized by epic rows

Cards are color-coded by artifact type and connected with dependency arrows. Click any card to open a detail panel for inline editing. A minimap in the corner helps you navigate large projects.

### AI Chat Participant

Type `@agentcanvas` in VS Code chat to access 30+ slash commands powered by AI:

### Language Model Tools

Agile Agent Canvas registers tools that AI models can call autonomously during chat conversations:

- **agentcanvas_read_file** — Read BMAD framework files, schemas, workflows, and agent definitions
- **agentcanvas_list_directory** — Discover available workflows, agents, schemas, and steps
- **agentcanvas_update_artifact** — Persist artifact changes directly from AI refinement

### Workflow System

44 built-in workflows organized by module guide you through structured product development processes. Workflows have defined steps, validation checkpoints, and produce artifacts that populate your canvas automatically. Track progress in the dedicated **Workflow Progress** sidebar view.

### Export and Import

- **Export** artifacts as Markdown, JSON, JIRA CSV, or all formats at once
- **Import** from a JSON file with Replace or Merge strategies
- Overwrite protection warns you before replacing existing artifacts

### Sidebar and Canvas

- **Visual Canvas** — Opens in an editor tab via `Agile Agent Canvas: Open Visual Canvas` or the sidebar header icon
- **Artifacts** — Sidebar tree view of all project artifacts organized by type
- **Workflow Progress** — Sidebar tree view showing current workflow steps and completion status

---

## Getting Started

1. **Install** Agile Agent Canvas from the Extensions marketplace
2. **Open the sidebar** by clicking the Agile Agent Canvas icon in the activity bar
3. **Create a new project** using the `Agile Agent Canvas: New Project` command, or load demo data with `Agile Agent Canvas: Load Demo Data`
4. **Open the canvas** via the sidebar header icon or run `Agile Agent Canvas: Open Visual Canvas` from the command palette
5. **Start chatting** with `@agentcanvas /vision` to define your product vision, then work through requirements, epics, and stories

### Recommended Workflow

```
@agentcanvas /vision       -> Define what you're building and why
@agentcanvas /requirements -> Extract functional and non-functional requirements
@agentcanvas /epics        -> Structure work into value-driven epics
@agentcanvas /stories      -> Break epics into implementable stories
@agentcanvas /readiness    -> Validate everything is ready for development
@agentcanvas /dev          -> Start building with full context
```
